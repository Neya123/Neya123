Hello, world! I'm Neya Babu Thayyil, a passionate professional with a love for turning ideas into reality through code.

🚀 As a recent graduate, I specialize in data science, bringing a fresh and analytical perspective to every project I embark on. Proficient in Python programming, I enjoy leveraging my coding skills to wrangle and analyze data effectively. My toolbox extends to business analytics tools like Tableau and Power BI, where I transform complex datasets into visually compelling stories.

🌐 In my GitHub repositories, you'll find a collection of projects that showcase my commitment to clean code, elegant design, and continuous improvement. Whether it's Wheelchair gaurdian, Healthcare-Cost-Estimation-Using-Machine-Learning-And-Deep-Learning, or Diabetic-retinopathy-using-ALEXNET-and-LENET-CNN-models, each repository reflects my dedication to delivering high-quality software.

🔧 I am proficient in Python Programming and business oriented skills, and I'm always excited to learn and adopt new technologies that can enhance my capabilities as a developer. My commitment to staying updated with industry trends allows me to contribute effectively to cutting-edge projects.

📈  Beyond coding, I'm driven by my passions. Photography allows me to capture moments that tell stories beyond numbers. Volunteering to help others is a cause close to my heart, and I believe in the transformative power of collaboration and knowledge sharing

🌻 When not immersed in data, you'll find me in the garden, nurturing plants and finding parallels between the growth of data and the growth of nature

💡I welcome feedback, collaboration, and connections with like-minded individuals who share a passion for data and its endless possibilities. Let's connect and create something amazing together! Feel free to reach out via callmeneya@gmail.com or LinkedIn, and let the journey begin.

📸🌍 Thanks for stopping by. I look forward to connecting with fellow data enthusiasts, photographers, volunteers, and gardeners alike! Happy coding!
